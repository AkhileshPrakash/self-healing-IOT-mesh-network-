# 🌐 Self-Healing IoT Mesh Network Simulation

![Hero](images/hero.png)

> A decentralized communication system where nodes **discover**, **connect**, and **recover automatically** when failures occur.

This project demonstrates how disaster-ready IoT devices can maintain communication **without internet or cellular infrastructure**.

## 🧠 The Idea

During disasters, traditional communication networks collapse.

This simulation proves that a **mesh of independent wireless nodes** can:

✔ create routes  
✔ relay messages  
✔ bypass failures  
✔ adapt in real time  

and still deliver critical information.

## ✨ Features

![Features](images/features.png)

- 🔁 Self-healing rerouting  
- 📡 Multi-hop packet transmission  
- 🧠 Intelligent neighbor discovery  
- 💾 Store & forward buffering  
- 🎮 Interactive controls  
- 📊 Live visual feedback  

---

## 📡 Mesh Connectivity

![Mesh](images/mesh.png)

Nodes automatically form links when they enter communication range.  
The network continuously updates paths to maintain connectivity.

---

## 🔥 Failure & Rerouting

![Rerouting](images/rerouting.png)

If a node goes offline:

⚡ broken routes are detected  
⚡ new paths are calculated  
⚡ communication continues  

No human intervention required.
